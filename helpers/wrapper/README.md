# Wrapper

[AirSwap](https://www.airswap.io/) is a peer-to-peer trading network for Ethereum tokens. This package contains an example contract that wraps and unwraps ether for WETH trades in the Swap Protocol. The Wrapper contract is designed to work primarily with AirSwap Instant application [https://instant.airswap.io/tokens]. It allows consumers to send ether and receive ether while the Swap protocol handles ERC20 and ERC721 token transfers.
