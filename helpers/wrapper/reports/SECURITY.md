# Security Report: Wrapper

Smart Contract Security Report by Team Fluidity (team[at]fluidity[dot]io) and Phil Daian (feedback[at]stableset[dot]com)
Hash of master used for report: [4af8d83e8d5d52c183cacf0544a55a352b7bfc60](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-protocols/commit/4af8d83e8d5d52c183cacf0544a55a352b7bfc60)

Wrapper [Source Code](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-protocols/tree/master/helpers/wrapper) and [README](../README.md)

## Introduction

The Wrapper contract acts as an intermediary contract to facilitate using Ether with the AirSwap contract. When performing a swap using the Airswap protocol, if given ether instead of WETH, it will convert ether to WETH and then perform the swap. Additionally, if receiving WETH, it will perform the swap, and convert the WETH into Ether. The contracts are compiled with v0.5.10.a6ea5b19 (0.5.10 stable release).

## Structure

The Swap contract is comprised a contract.

| Function   | Source   | Visibility | Params                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Payable |

## Invariants

#### 1. No ether or tokens should be held by the contract address due to an incorrect swap.
WETH and Swap functions REVERTS on any failure cases within Wrapper. Similarly, Wrapper will REVERT in case any movements of tokens or ether fails within Wrapper.swapSimple().

#### 2. Contract Ether and Token balances should remain unchanged after each swap.
Wrapper does not perform any arithmetic computation, or calling this.balance. It passses the full token or ether amounts received along or REVERTS the transaction.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 3. If Ether is sent with a swap, it should be deposited to WETH and then traded..
- When ETH is sent to the contract by the taker, the wrapper contract will forward the amount sent to the WETH contract and perform the swap. This prevents the contract from holding any Ether and subsequently any WETH.

- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 4. If WETH is received with a swap, it should be withdrawn and sent to the sender.
- When WETH is sent to the contract by the taker, the wrapper contract will perform the swap and obtain WETH, the WETH is then withdrawn and transferred to the maker. If there are any failed transactions, the overall transaction will REVERT.

- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 5. ISwap and IWeth contracts are immutable, any updates will require new deploy of Wrapper.
- There are no methods within the Wrapper that allow the Swap contract or the WETH contract to be set; the Swap and WETH values provided on deployment are permanent. There is no functionality whatsoever that allows changing the addresses.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 6. Protected from re-entrancy attacks such that multiple parties could use Wrapper and receive more balances.

#### 7. Sending the same parameters twice will have the same guarantees as the Swap contract.
Calls to swapSimple() are idempotent. When called many times. The wrapperâ€™s beginning and final state are the same due to having either swapped WETH or transferring ETH out of the contract.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 8. non-WETH ERC20 swaps with non-null taker address should occur similar to Swap.swapSimple.
- In this scenario, none of the conditional statements for swapSimple() in Wrapper are hit and thus just swapContract.swapSimple() method was called.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

## Analysis

#### Slither (static analyzer)

Medium Severity Detected:
Wrapper.constructor (Wrapper.sol#42-51) ignores return value by external calls "wethContract.approve(_swapContract,MAX_INT)" (Wrapper.sol#50)

Wrapper.swapSimple (Wrapper.sol#72-141) ignores return value by external calls "wethContract.transferFrom(_takerWallet,address(this),_makerAmount)" (Wrapper.sol#122)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#unused-return

External call is being made to a known contract implementation of WETH9.sol. WETH9.sol either returns True of revert, there are no instances
where it returns False during approve or transferFrom.

## Notes

- Because of two issues found with ABIEncoderV2, we ensured that the newest version of the Solidity compiler was used where those issues were resolved. More information can be found at the [Ethereum Foundation blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug/).
- Smart contracts are a nascent space, and no perfect security audit procedure has thus far been perfected for their deployment. We welcome any suggestions or comments on this report, its contents, our methodology, or potential gaps in coverage.
